### To escalate or not to escalate

**Malware infection**

An incident type that occurs when malicious software designed to dirupt a system infiltrates an organization's computers or network

**Unautorized access**

An incident type that occurs when an individual gains digital or physical access to a system or application wihtout permission

> Brute force attacks use trial and error to compromise passwords, login credentials, and encryption keys.

**Improper usage**

An incident type that occurs when an employee of an organization violates the organization's acceptable use policies


### Timing is everything

> The impact of an attacker gaining unauthorized access to a manufacturing application or PII is far greater than a forgotten password.

**Escalation policy**

A set of actions that outline who should be notified when an incident alert occurs and how that incident should be handled

> Attention to detail can make the difference between escalating an incident to the right or wrong person. It can also help you prioritize which incidents need to be escalated with more or less urgency.
