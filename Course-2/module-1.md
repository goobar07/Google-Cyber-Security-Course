# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks [Course 2]

## Module 1 - Security Domains

### Learnings

- CISSP's eight security domains
- Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities
- Layers of the web
- The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)

### The CISSP's Security Domains

**Security posture**

An organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change.

**Domain 1 - Security and risk management**

Focused on defiing security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.

**Risk mitigation**

The process of having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.

**Business continuity**

An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

**Domain 2 - Asset security**

Focused on securing digital and physical assets. It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.

**Domain 3 - Security architecture and engineering**

Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.

**Shared responsibility**

All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.

**Domain 4 - Communication and network security**

Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.

**Domain 5 - Identity and access management**

Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.

**Components of IAM**

- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accountability

**Domain 6 - Security assessment and testing**

Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

**Domain 7 - Security operations**

Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

**Domain 8 - Software development security**

Focused on using secure coding practices.

### Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

**Threat**

Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.

**Social engineering**

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuable.

**Risks**

Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset. Ex - Lack of protocols to take action against a attack.

> Companies mark assets as High-risk, Medium-risk, and Low-risk asset.

**Low-risk asset**

Information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.

**Medium-risk asset**

Information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.

**High-risk asset**

Information protecterd by regulations or laws, which if compromised would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.

**Vulnerability**

A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

### Key impacts of Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

**Ransomware**

A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.

**Layers of the web**

- Surface web
- Deep web
- Dark web

**Key Impacts**

- Financial
- Identity theft
- Reputation

### NIST's Risk Management Framework

**Risk Management Framework (RMF)**

- Prepare
- Categorize
- Select
- Implement
- Assess
- Authorize
- Monitor

**RMF Step 1: Prepare**

Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.

**RMF Step 2: Categorize**

Used to develop risk management processes and tasks.

**RMF Step 3: Select**

Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.

**RMF Step 4: Implement**

Implement security and privacy plans for the organization.

**RMF Step 5: Assess**

Determine if established controls are implemented correctly.

**RMF Step 6: Authorize**

Being accuntable for the security and privacy that may exist in an organization.

**RMF Step 7: Monitor**

Be aware of how systems are operating.
