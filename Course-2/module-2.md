# Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks [Course 2]

## Module 2 - Security Frameworks and Controls

### Learnings

- Frameworks
- Controls
- Design principles
- Security audits

### Frameworks

**Security frameworks**

Guidelines are used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy.


### Controls

**Security controls**

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks.

**Encryption**

The process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format.

**Authentication**
The process of verfying who someone or something is.

**Biometrics**

Unique physical characteristics that can be used to verify a person's identity.

**Vishing**

The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.


**Authorization**
The concept of granting access to specific resources wihtin a system.

### Explore the CIA Triad

**CIA triad**

A model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.

**Confidentiality**

Only authorized users can access specific assets or data.

**Integrity**

The data is correct, authentic, and reliable.

**Availability**

Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.

### NIST Frameworks

**NIST Cybersecurity Frameworks (CSF)**

A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

**CSF's 5 Core Functions**

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover

**NIST S.P. 800-53**

A unified framework for protecting the security of information systems within the fedral government.

### Explore the five functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**Identify**

The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets.

**Protect**

The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats.

**Detect** 

Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections.

**Respond**

Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process.

**Recover**

The process of returning affected systems back to normal operations.

### OWASP Security Principles

**Open Web Applications Security Project (OWASP) security principles**

- Minimize the attack surface area
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth
- Separation of duties
- Keep security simple
- Fix security issues correctly

### Plan a security audit

**Security audit**

A review of an organization's security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations.

**Internal security audit**

An internal security audit is typically conducted by a team of people that might include an organization's compliance officer, security manager, and other security team members. Internal security audits are used to help improve an organization's security posture and help organizations avoid fines from governing agencies due to a lack of compliance.

**Purposes of internal security audit**

- Identify organizational risk
- Assess controls
- Correct compliance issues

**Common elements of internal audits**

- Establishing the scope and goals
- Conducting a risk assessment
- Completing a controls assessment
- Assessing compliance 
- Communicating resluts

**Scope**

Scope refers to the specific criteria of an internal security audit.

**Goals**

Goals are an outline of the organization's security objectives.

**Risk Assessment**

It is focused on identifying potential threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. This helps organizations consider what security measures should be implemented and monitored to ensure the safety of assets. Similar to establishing the scope and goals, a risk assessment is oftentimes completed by managers or other stakeholders. However, you might be asked to analyze details provided in the risk assessment to consider what types of controls and compliance regulations need to be in place to help improve the organization's security posture.

**Audit Questions**

- What is the audit meant to achieve?
- Which assets are most at risk?
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
- What controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?

**Control Categories**

- Administrative controls
- Techincal controls
- Physical controls

**Stakeholder Communication**

- Summarizes scope and goals
- Lists existing risks
- Notes how quickly those risks need to be addressed
- Identifies compliance regulations
- Provides recommendations
