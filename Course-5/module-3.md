# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Module 3 - Vulnerabilities in systems

### Learnings

- Vulnerability management process
- Defense in depth model
- The CVE list
- Attack surfaces
- Common attack vectors


### Flaws in the system

**Vulnerability**

A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

**Exploit**

A way of taking advantage of a vulnerability

**Vulnerability management**

The process of finding and patching vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability management process**

1. Identify vulnerabilities
2. Consider potential exploits
3. Prepare defenses against threats
4. Evaluate those defenses

**Zero-day**

An exploit that was previously unknown

**Defense in depth**

A layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk

**Defense in depth strategy**

1. Perimeter layer
2. Network layer
3. Endpoint layer
4. Application layer
5. Data layer 

**Exposure**

A mistake that can be exploited by a threat

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure list (CVE list)**

An openly accessible dicitonary of known vulnerabilities and exposures

**MITRE**

A collection of non-profit research and development centers

**CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)**

An organization that volunteers to analyze and distribute information on eligible CVEs

**CVE list criteria**

1. Independent of other issues
2. Recognized as a potential security risk
3. Submitted with supporiting evidence
4. Only affect one codebase

**Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)**

A measurement system that scores the severity of a vulnerability


### Identify system vulnerabilities

**Vulnerability assessment**

The internal review process of an organization's security systems

**Vulnerability assessment process**

1. Identification
2. Vulnerability analysis
3. Risk assessment
4. Remediation

**Attack surface**

All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit

**Security hardening**

The process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerabilities and attack surface

**Attack vectors**

The pathways attackers use to penetrate security defenses

**Practicing an attacker mindest**

1. Identify a tagert
2. Determine how the target can be accessed
3. Evaluate attack vectors that can be exploited
4. Find the tools and methods of attack

**Defending attack vectors**

1. Educating users
2. Applying the principle of least privilege
3. Using the right security contols and tools
4. Building a diverse security team
