# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Module 4 - Threats to assest security

### Learnings

- Social engineering
- Malware
- Web-based exploits
- Threat modeling process 

**Threat**

Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets


### Social engineering

**Social engineering**

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables

**Stages of social engineering**

1. Prepare
2. Establish trust
3. Use persuasion tactics
4. Disconnet from the target

**Preventing social engineering**

- Implementing managerial controls
- Staying informed of threats
- Sharing your knowledge with others

**Phishing**

The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

**Phishing kit**

A collection of software tools needed to launch a phishing campaign

**Phishing kit tools**

- Malicious attachments
- Fake data-collection forms
- Fraudulent web links

**Smishing**

The use of text messages to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

**Vishing**

The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or impersonate a known source

**Phishing security measures**

- Anti-phishing policies
- Employee training resources
- Email filters
- Intrusion prevention systems


### Malware

**Malware**

Software designed to harm devices or networks

**Types of malware**

1. Virus
2. Worm
3. Trojan
4. Ransomware
5. Spyware

**Virus**

Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software

**Worm**

Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own

**Trojan (or Trojan horse)**

Malware that looks like a legitimate file or program

**Ransomware**

Type of malicious attack where attackers encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access

**Spyware**

Malware that's used to gather and sell information without consent

**Cryptojacking**

A form of malware that installs software to illegally mine cryptocurrencies

**Intrusion detection systems (IDS)**

An application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions

**Signs of cryptojacking**

- Slowdown
- Increased CPU usage
- Sudden system crashes
- Fast draining batteries
- Unusually high electricity costs


### Web-based exploits

**Web-based exploits**

Malicious code or behavior that's used to take advantage of coding flaws in a web application

**Injection attack**

Malicious code inserted into a vulnerable application

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)**

An injection attack that inserts code into vulnerable website or web application

**Types of cross-site scripting attacks**

1. Reflected
2. Stored
3. DOM-based

**Reflected XSS attack**

An instance when malicious script is sent to a server and activated during the server's response

**Stored XSS attack**

An instance when malicious script is injected directly on the server

**DOM-based XSS attack**

An instance when malicious script exists in the webpage a browser loads

**SQL injection**

An attack that executes unexpected queries on a database

**Prepared statement**

A coding technique that executes SQL statements before passing them on to the database


### Threat modeling

**Threat modeling**

The process of identifying assets, their vulnerabilities, and how each is exposed to threats

**Threat modeling steps**

1. Define the scope
2. Identify threats
3. Characterize the environment
4. Analyze threats
5. Mitigate risk
6. Evaluate findings 

**Threat actor**

Any person or group who presents a security risk

**Attack tree**

A diagram that maps threats to assets

**PASTA**

A popular threat modeling framework that's used across many industries

> **P**rocess for
> **A**ttack
> **S**imulation and 
> **T**hreat
> **A**nalysis

**PASTA threat model framework**

1. Define business and security objectives
2. Define the technical scope
3. Decompose the application
4. Perform a threat analysis
5. Perform a vulnerability analysis
6. Conduct attack modeling
7. Analyze risk and impact
