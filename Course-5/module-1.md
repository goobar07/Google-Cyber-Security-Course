### Introduction to assets

**Risk**

Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset

**Security risk planning**

- Assets
- Threats
- Vulnerabilities

**Asset**

An item perceived as having value to an organization

**Threat**

Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

**Vulnerability**

A weakness that can be exploited by a threat

**Asset management**

The process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them

**Asset inventory**

A catalog of assets that need to be protected

**Asset classification**

The practice of labeling assets based on sensitivity and importance to an organization

**Levels of asset classifiation**

- Public
- Internal-only
- Confidential
- Restricted


### Assets in a digital world

**Data**

Information that is translated, processed, or stored by a computer

**States of data**

- In use
- In transit
- At rest

**Data in use**

Data being accessed by one or more users

**Data in transit**

Data traveling from one point to another

**Data at rest**

Data not cureently being accessed

**Information security (InfoSec)**

The practice of keeping data in all states away from unauthorized users


### Elements of a security plan

**Types of risk categories**

- Damage 
- Disclosure
- Loss of information

**Elements of a security plan**

- Policies
- Standards
- Procedures

**Policy**

A set of rules that reduces risk and protects information

**Standards**

References that inform how to set policies

**Procedures**

Step-by-step intructions to perform a specific security task


### The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

**Compliance**

The process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

**Regulations**

Rules set by a government or other authority to control the way something is done

**NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**

A volunatary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

**NIST CSF components**

- Core
- Tiers
- Profiles

**Five functions of the NIST CSF core**

- Identify
- Protect
- Detect
- Respond
- Recover
