# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Module 2 - Protect organizational assets

### Learnings

- Effective data handling processes
- The role of encryption and hashing in safeguarding information
- Standard access controls


### Safegaurd Information

**Security controls**

Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

**Types of security controls**

- Technical
- Operational
- Managerial


**Information privacy**

The protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data

**Principle of least privilege**

The concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task or function

**Data owner**

The person that decides who can access, edit, use or destory their information

**Data custodian**

Anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information


### Encryption Methods

**Personally identifiable information (PII)**

Any information that can be used to infer an individual's identity

**Cryptography**

The process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can't understand

**Algorithm**

A set of rules used that solve a problem

**Cipher**

An algorithm that encrypts information

**Cryptographic key**

A mechanism that decrypts ciphertext

**Brute force attack**

A trial and error process of discovering private information

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

An encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online

**Public Key Infrastructure process**

1. Exchange of encrypted information
2. Establish trust using a system of digital certificates

**Asymmetric encryption**

The use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data

**Symmeteric encryption**

The use of a single secret key to exchange information

**Digital certificate**

A file that verifies the identity of a public key holder

**Hash Function**

An algorithm that produces a code that can't be decrypted

**Non-repudiation**

The concept that the authenticity of information can't be denied


### Authenticating, Authorization, and Accounting

**Access Control**

Security controls that manage access, authorization, and accountability of information

**AAA framework**

- Authentication
- Authorization
- Accounting

**Factors of authentication**

1. Knowledge: something the user knows
2. Ownership: something the user possesses
3. Characteristic: something the user is

**Single sign-on (SSO)**

A technology that combines several different logins into one

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

A security measure which requires a user to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network

**Sepration of duties**

The principle that users should not be given levels of authorization that would allow them to misuse a system

**Basic auth**

The technology used to establish a user's request to access a server

**O Auth**

An open-standard authorization protocol that shares designated access between applications

**API token**

A small block of encrypted code that contains information about a user

**Session**

A sequence of network HTTP basic auth requests and responses associated with the same user

**Session ID**

A unique token that identifies a user and their device while accessing the system

**Session cookie**

A token that websites use to validate a session and determine how long that session should last

**Session hijacking**

An event when attackers obtain a legitimate user's session ID
