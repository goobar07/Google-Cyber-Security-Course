# Sound the Alarm: Detection and Response

## Module 2 - Network monitoring and analysis

### Learnings

- Network traffic flows
- Packet sniffers
- Packet analysis


### Understand network traffic

**Network traffic**

The amount of data that moves across a network

**Network data**

The data that's transmitted between devices on a network

**Indicators of compromise (IOC)**

Observable evidence that suggests signs of a potential security incident

**Data exfiltration**

Unauthorized transmission of data from a system

**Defensive measures**

1. Prevent attacker access
2. Monitor network activity
3. Protect assets
4. Detect and stop the exfiltration


### Capture and view network traffic

**Components of a packet**

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Footer

**Network protocol analyzer (packet sniffer)**

A tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network

**Packet capture (P-cap)**

A file containing data packets intercepted from an interface or network
