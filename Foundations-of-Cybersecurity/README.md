### Introduction to Cyber Security

Organization needs to be prepared for cyber security attacks and quickly respond to the outside threats. Security Analyst prtotect there organization and the people it serves from a variety of risks and outside threads and if threat does get through they and there team will provide a solution to eliminate the threat and return to normal state. 


### Cybersecurity (or security)
The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.


**Threat actor** - Any person or group who presents a security risk.

### Benefits of Security
- Protects against external and internal threats
- Meets regulatory compliance
- Maintains and improves buisness productivity
- Reduces expenses
- Maintain brand trust

### Common Job Ttitles

- Security analyst or specialist
- Cybersecurity analyst or specialist
- Security operations center (SOC) analyst
- Information security analyst

### Responsibility of Security Analyst

Security analyst are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.

- Protecting computer and network systems
- Installing prevention software
- Conducting periodic security audits

### Day in a Life of Security Analyst

- Operations: Responding to detections and doing investigations
- Projects: Working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections

**Playbook**
"A playbook is a list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents."

### Common Cyber Security Terminology

**Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.

**Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.

**Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.

**Security posture** is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

A **threat actor**, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk. This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.

An **internal threat** can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk. At times, an internal threat is accidental. For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat. Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.

**Network security** is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.

**Cloud security** is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users. The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet. Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.

**Programming** is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. These tasks can include:

- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., searching a list of malicious domains)

- Reviewing web traffic 

- Alerting suspicious activity
