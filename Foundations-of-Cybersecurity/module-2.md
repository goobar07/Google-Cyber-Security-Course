1. **Security and Risk Management** 
Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, buisness continuity, and the law. 

2. **Asset Security**
Secure digital and physical asstes. It's also related to the storage, maintainance, retention, and destruction of data.

3. **Security Architecture and Engineering**
Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and process are in place.

4. **Communications and Network Security**
Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications.

5. **Identity and Access Management**
Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and mange physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications.

6. **Security Assessment and Testing**
Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

7. **Security Operations**
Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.

8. **Software Development Security**
Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
