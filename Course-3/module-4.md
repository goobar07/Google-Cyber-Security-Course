## Module 4 - Security Hardening

### Learnings

- Security hardening
- OS hardening
- Network hardening practices
- Cloud network hardening

**Where security hardening occurs**

- Devices
- Networks
- Applications
- Cloud infrastructure

**Security analysts responsibilities in security hardening**

- Patch updates
- Backups


### Security Hardening

**Security hardening**

The process of strengthrning a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface.

**Attack surface**

All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

**Security hardening is conducted on**

- Hardware
- Operating systems
- Applications
- Computer networks
- Databases

**Penetration test**

A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.


### OS Hardening Practices

**Operating system (OS)**

The interface between computer hardware and the user.

**Patch update**

A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

**Baselien configuration (baseline image)**

A documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.

**Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**

A security measure which requires a use to verify their identity in two or more ways to access a system or network.

**Categories of multi-factor identification**

- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something unique about you


### Newtork Hardening Practices

**Network security hardening**

- Port filtering
- Network access privilege
- Encryption 

**Tasks performed**

- Firewall rules maintenance
- Network log analysis
- Patch updates
- Server backups

**Network log analysis**

The process of examining network logs to identify events of interest.
