# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Module 2 - Network Operations

### Learnings

- Network protocols
- Virtual private networks (VPNs)
- Firewalls, security zones, and proxy servers


### Network Protocols

**Network protocols**

A set of rules used by two or more devices on a network to describe the order of delivery and the structure of the data.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**

An internet communications protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

**Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**

A network protocol used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device on the path.

**Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**

A network protocol that provides a secure method of communication between clients and website server.

**Domain Name System (DNS)**

A network protocol that translates internet domain names into IP addresses.

**Security protocols**

- HTTPS
- SSL/TLS


### Wireless Protocols

**IEEE 802.11 (WiFi)**

A set of standard that define communication for wireless LANs.

**WiFi Protected Access (WPA)**

A wireless security protocol for devices to connect to the internet.


### Firewall and Network Security Measures

**Firewall**

A network security device that monitors traffic to and from your network.

**Port filtering**

A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication.

**Cloud-based firewalls**

Software firewalls that are hosted by a cloud service provider.

**Stateful**

A class of firewall that keeps track of information passing through it and proactively filters out threats.

**Stateless**

A class of firewall that operates based on predefined rules and dows not keep track of information from data packets.

**Benefits of next generation firewalls (NGFWs)**

- Deep packet inspection
- Intrusion protection
- Threat intelligence


### Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) 

**Virtual Private Network (VPN)**

A network security service that changes your public IP address and hides your virtual location so that you can keep your data private when you are using a public network like the internet.

**Encapsulation**

A process performed by a VPN service that protects your data by wrapping sensitive data in other data packets.


### Security Zones

**Security zone**

A segment of a network that protects the internal network from the internet.

**Network segmentation**

A security technique that divides the network into segments.
