# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Module 1 - Network Architecture

### Learnings

- Structure of a network
- Standard networking tools
- Cloud networks
- TCP/IP model

### What are networks?

**Network**

A group of connected devices.

**Local Area Network (LAN)**

A network that spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home.

**Wide Area Network (WAN)**

A network that spans a large geographics area like, a city, state or country.


### Networks tools

**Hub**

A network device that broadcasts information to every device on the network.

**Switch**

A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receving data between them. More intelligent than a hub.

**Router**

A network device that connects multiple networks together.

**Modem**

A device that connects your router to the interent and brings internet access to the LAN.

**Virtualization tools**

Pieces of software that perform network operations.


### Cloud networks

**Cloud computing**

The practise of using remote server, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.

**Cloud network**

A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in remote data centers that can be accessed via the internet.

**Cloud service providers offer**

- On-demand storage
- Processing power
- Analytics


### Introduction to network communication

**Data packet**

A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network.

**Bandwidth**

The amount of data a device receives every second.

**Speed**

The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded.

**Packet sniffing**

The practise of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.


### The TCP/IP model

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**

An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data.

**Internet Protocol (IP)**

A set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices on a network.

**Port**

A software-based location that organized the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network.

**Common port numbers**

- Port 25 - Email
- Port 443 - Secure internet communication
- Port 20 - Large file transfers

### The four layers of the TCP/IP model

**TCP/IP model**

A framework used to visualize how data is organized and transmitted acroos the network.

**Layers of the TCP/IP model**

1. Network access layer
2. Internet layer
3. Transport layer
4. Application layer

**Network access layer (layer one)**

The network access layer deals with creation of data packets and their transmission across the network. This includes hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches that direct data to its destination.

**Internet layer (layer two)**

The internet layer is where IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver. The internet layer also focuses on how networks connect to each other. For example, data packets containing information that determine whether they will stay on the LAN or will be sent to a remote network, like the internet.

**Transport layer (layer three)**

The transport layer includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network. These protocols permit or deny communication with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, which ensures data is flowing smoothly across the network.

**Application layer (layer four)**

The application layer, protocols determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices. Functions that are organized at application layer include file transfers and email services.
 

### IP addresses and network communication

**Internet Protocol (IP) address**

A unique string of characters that identifies the location of a device on the internet.

**Types of IP addresses**

- IP version 4 (IPv4). Ex - 19.117.63.126
- IP version 6 (IPv6). Ex - 684D:1111:222:3333:4444:5555:6:77

**MAC address**

A unique alphanumeric identifier that is assigned to each physical device on a network.
