# Connect and Protect: Networks and Network Security

## Module 3 - Secure Against Network Intrusions

### Learnings

- Network security
- Network intrusion tactics
- Network attack protection

### Securing Networks

**Common network intrusion attacks**

- Malware
- Spoofing
- Packet sniffing
- Packet flooding

**Attacks can harm an organization by**

- Leaking valuable or confidential information
- Damaging an organization's reputation
- Impacting customer retention
- Costing money and time

**The Three C's**

- Command
- Control
- Communications


### Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

**Denial of service attack (DoS)**

An attack that targets a network or server and floods it with network traffic.

**Distributed denial of service attack (DDoS)**

A type of denial of service attack that uses multiple devices or servers in different locations to flood the target network with unwanted traffic.

**SYN (synchronize) flood attack**

A type of DoS attack that simulates a TCP connection and floods a server with SYN packets.

**Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**

An internet protocol used by devices to tell each other about data transmission errors across the network.

**Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) flood**

A type of DoS attack performed by an attacker repeatedly sending ICMP packets to a network server.

**Ping of death**

A type of DoS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 63KB.


### Malicious Packet Sniffing

**Packet sniffing**

The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network.

**Passive packet sniffing**

A type of attack where data packets are read in transit.

**Active packet sniffing**

A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit.


### IP Spoofing

**IP spoofing**

A network attack performed when an attacker changes the source IP of a data packet to impersonate an authorized system and gain access to a network.

**Common IP spoofing attacks**

- On-path attack
- Replay attack
- Smurf attack

**On-path attack**

An attack where a malicious actor places themselves in the middle of an authorized connection and intercepts or alters the data in transit.

**Replay attack**

A network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time.

**Smurf attack**

A network attack performed when an attacker sniffs an authorized user's IP address and floods it with packets.
