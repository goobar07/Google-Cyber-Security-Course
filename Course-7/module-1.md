## Module 1 - Introduction to Python

### Learnings

- Basics of programming
- Data types
- Variables
- Conditional statements
- Iterative statements


### Introduction to Python programming in cybersecurity

**Programming**

Used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks

**Automation**

The use of technology to reduce human and manual effort to perform common and repetitive tasks

**Advantages of Python**

- Resembles human language
- Less code
- Easy to read
- Standard guidelines
- Online support
- Built-in code

**Comment**

A note programmers make about the intention behind their code

**`print()`**

Outputs a specified object to the screen

**Syntax**

The rules that determine what is correctly structured in a computing language


### Core Python components

**Data type**

Category for a particular type of data item

**String data**

Data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters

**Float data**

Data consisting of a number with a decimal point

**Integer data**

Data consisting of a number that does not include a decimal point

**Boolean data**

Data that can only be one of two values: either True or False

**List data**

Data structure that consists of a collection of data in sequential form

**Variable**

A container that stores data

**`type()`**

Returns the data type of its input

**Type error**

An error that results from using the wrong data type


### Conditional and iterative statements

**Conditional statement**

A statement that evaluates code to determine if it meets a specified set of conditions

**`if`**

Starts a conditional statement

**Operators**

- >
- <
- >=
- <=
- ==
- !=

**`==`**

Evaluates whether two objects match

**`!=`**

Evaluates whether two object are different

**`else`**

Precedes a code section that only evaluates when all conditions that precede it within the conditional statement evaluate to `False`

**Iterative statement**

Code that repeatedly executes a set of instuctions

**Loop**

https://skillsforall.com/career-path/cybersecurity?courseLang=en-USSetting up a **loop** allows us to repeatedly use a line of code without having to type it multiple times

**`for`**

Signals for beginning of `for` loop

**Loop variable**

A variable that is used to control the iterations of a loop

**`range()`**

Generates a sequence of numbers

> `while` loops still repeatedly execute, but this repetition is based on a condition

**`while`**

Signals the beginning of a `while` loop
