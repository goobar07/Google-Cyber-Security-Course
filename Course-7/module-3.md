# Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python

## Module 3 - Work with strings and lists

### Learnings

- Working with strings and lists
- Writing algorithms
- Using regular expressions


### Working with strings

**String data**

Data consisting of an ordered sequence of characters

**Examples of strings**

- "Hello"
- "123"
- "Number 1!"

**`str()`**

Converts the input object into a string

**`len()`**

Returns the number of elements in an object

**String concatenation**

The process of joining two strings together

**Method**

A function that belongs to a specific data type

**`.upper()`**

Returns a copy of the string in all uppercase letters

**`.lower()`**

Returns a copy of the string in all lowercase letters

**Index**

A number assigned to every element in a sequence that indicates its position

**`.index()`**

Finds the first occurrence of the input in a string and returns its location

**Immutable**

Cannot be changed after it is created and assigned a value


### Work with lists and develop algorithms

**List concatenation**

Combining two lists into one by placing the elements of the second list directly after the elements of the first list

**`.insert()`**

Adds an element in a specific position inside a list

**`.remove()`**

Removes the first occurrence of a specific element in a list

**Algorithm**

A set of rules that solve a problem

**Solving the problem**

1. Use string slicing to extract the first 3 digits from one IP address
2. Use a loop to apply that solution to every IP address on the list

**`.append()`**

Adds input to the end of a list


### Regular expression

**Regular expression (regex)**

A sequence of characters that forms a pattern

**`+`**

Represents one or more occurrences of a specific character

**`\w`**

Matches with any alphanumric character but it doesn't match symbols

**`re.findall()`**

Returns a list of matches to a regular expression
